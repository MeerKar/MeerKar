# WebScraping
In this project, by using HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup and scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
